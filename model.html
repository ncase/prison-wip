<h2>
Schools &amp; Prisons
</h2>
<div style="font-size:25px; text-align:right; position:relative; top:-15px;">[a very early prototype]</div>

<p>
The United States has 5% of the world's population,
but 25% of the world's prisoners.
That's, uh, kind of embarassing.
</p>

<p>
But it's hard to see the full context of such a huge systemic problem.
So, I've taken the national statistics on
age, race, education, income, crime, etc...
and made a simulation that <i>connects</i> all these factors together:
</p>

<p>
<div class="button" onclick="Sim.config.stats.sim_start = {value:true}; Sim.update();">
START THE SIMULATION
</div>
</p>

<p>
Every "person" in this simulation
has their own life story,
and this simulation gives us 
100 stories per minute.
</p>

<p style="text-align:right; font-size:30px">
click a person to focus on their story &rarr;
</p>

<p>
By combining <b>systems, stories &amp; statistics</b>,
maybe we can get a better idea on how to solve our mass incarceration problem!
This simulation will show us that 
&mdash;
contrary to what many of us believe
&mdash;
injustice is not the <i>cause</i> of a bad system,
it's the <i>result</i>.
</p>

<p>

<h2>
Inside The System
</h2>

<p>
The people in this sim, and their lives,
are based off <b>the real national statistics
for low-income boys &amp; men.</b>
(other demographics get caught up in the incarceration system
too, of course, but this group is the most at-risk)
</p>

<p>
So, here are those stats, with sources attached!
You can modify the numbers, too &mdash;
to challenge my assumptions,
to use local data instead of national data,
to evaluate possible solutions,
or even to <i>create your own policies</i>.
</p>

<p class="edit_container" color="#227daa">

	For each year I'm in high school, I have...
	<edit stat="high_school_dropout"
		  label="a {% chance} of dropping out,">
	</edit>
	<edit stat="high_school_convicted"
		  label="and a {% chance} of being convicted.">
	</edit>

	<br>
	And if I graduate, I've got...
	<edit stat="high_school_to_college"
		  label="a {% chance} of going to college.">
	</edit>

</p>

<p class="edit_container" color="#1da0e2">

<p>
In tackling mass incarceration, or any big systemic problem,
there is no silver bullet &mdash; and that's a good thing.
That means, there are many, <i>many</i> ways to help,
not just directly within policy or prisons,
but also schools, businesses, and local communities.
</p>

<p>
We're <i>all</i> part of the system, for better or worse.
</p>

<h2>
What D'ya Think?
</h2>

<p>
The simulation and words and everything are super rough,
but I just wanted to run a first draft by you!
Later, I'll also add:
</p>

<p>
<ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
<li>
	Graphs of the simulation's crime rates, unemployment rates, incarceration rates, etc
	over time.
</li>
<li>
	A way to see how your policy changes affected the system,
	compared to the "default" settings.
</li>
<li>
	A way to <i>share</i> your own policy changes through a web link.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
What else do you think this interactive is missing?
Or, what do you think I should change, or cut out completely?
What do you think about the UI design?
What aspects did you like most about this, or least about this, and why?
</p>

<p>
I don't just want people to "learn" about the topic,
I want people to be able to actually <i>use</i> this thing:
to evaluate/design policies,
to use their own city's data,
to figure out what one can <i>personally</i> do to change the system.
</p>

<p>
So yeah, whatever feedback you gots will help a mega-tonne.
Thank you so much! :)
</p>
