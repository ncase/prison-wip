<p>
The United States has 5% of the world's population,
but 25% of the world's prisoners.
That's, uh, kind of embarassing.
</p>

<p>
But it's hard to see the full context of such a huge systemic problem.
So, I've taken the national statistics on
age, race, education, income, crime, etc...
and made a simulation that <i>connects</i> all these factors together:
</p>

<p style="text-align:right; font-size:30px">
click start &rarr;
</p>

<!--p>
<div class="button" onclick="Sim.isPlaying=true; Sim.update();">
START THE SIMULATION
</div>
</p-->

<p>
Every "person" in this simulation
has their own life story,
and this simulation gives us 
100 stories per minute.
</p>

<p style="text-align:right; font-size:30px">
click a person &rarr;
</p>

<p>
By combining <b>systems, stories &amp; statistics</b>,
maybe we can get a better idea on how to tackle our mass incarceration problem!
This simulation will show us that 
injustice is not the <i>cause</i> of a bad system,
it's the <i>result</i>.

<h2>
Inside The System
</h2>

<p>
This simulation is based off <b>the real national statistics
for low-income boys &amp; men.</b>
(other demographics get caught up in the criminal justice system
too, of course, but this group is the most at-risk)
</p>

<p>
The statistics determine how likely a person is to move from one box to another.
Here are those stats, with sources attached!
You can also modify the numbers &mdash;
to challenge my assumptions,
to use local data instead of national data,
to evaluate possible solutions,
or even to <i>create your own policies</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>TO-DO:</b><br>
* stats for age, race, nonviolent crime<br>
* link sources (mostly BJS.gov &amp; NCES.gov)
</p>

<p>
In tackling mass incarceration, or any big systemic problem,
there is no silver bullet &mdash; and that's a good thing.
That means, there are many, <i>many</i> ways to help,
not just directly within policy or prisons,
but also schools, businesses, and local communities.
</p>

<p>
We're <i>all</i> part of the system, for better or worse.

<h2>
What D'ya Think?
</h2>

<p>
Everything here is super rough,
but I just wanted to run a first draft by you!
</p>

<p>
What did you think about it?
What's missing, what should be taken out?
What did you like most, what did you like least?
And why?
</p>

<p>
I don't just want people to "learn" about the topic,
I want people to be able to actually <i>use</i> this thing:
to evaluate/design policies,
to use their own city's data,
to figure out what one can <i>personally</i> do to change the system.
</p>

<p>
So yeah, whatever feedback you gots will help a mega-tonne.
Thank you so much! :)
